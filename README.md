# walljumper
Arcade-style vertical platformer built around wall-jumping.

Controls/Instructions:

- Left-click or press spacebar to jump in an arc toward your cursor, with your mouse position at the peak of the jump.

- Left-click or press spacebar after jumping to cancel all momentum and perform a short, straight dash toward your cursor.

- Reset both jumps by touching any surface, but note that touching the same surface twice in a row will not work!

- If both jumps are available, you can dash before jumping if you click below your current position.

- Watch out for enemies and hazards, and collect powerups if you can get to them!

- Levels will get more difficult as your score increases.
